# You are designing the screen lock feature for a device that displays an 
# n x m grid of dots (think of a pattern lock on an Android phone).

# Your task is to count the number of distinct valid patterns a user can draw by 
# connecting the dots, following these constraints:

# Constraints:
# A pattern starts at any dot in the grid.
# From any current dot, you can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent dot (no diagonal moves).
# Each dot can be used only once in a single pattern (no revisiting).
# A pattern must be at least 1 dot long, and can include up to all nÃ—m dots.
