# Write a function, insert_node, that takes in the head of a linked list, a value, and an index. 
# The function should insert a new node with the value into the list at the specified index. Consider the 
# head of the linked list as index 0. The function should return the head of the resulting linked list.

# Do this in-place.

# You may assume that the input list is non-empty and the index is not greater than the length of the input list.
